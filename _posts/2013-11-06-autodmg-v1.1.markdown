AutoDMG version 1.1 has been released, with the following changes:

* Added support for InstallESD.dmg as source from Timothy Sutton.
* Better logging during package installs.
* Fix packages failing if they were in a folder with non-ascii characters in the name (thanks to Darkomen78).

You can download 1.1 from the [AutoDMG releases](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) page. If you have any questions join us in [##osx-server](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##osx-server) (but please check the [documentation](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/wiki) and especially the [FAQ](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/wiki/FAQ) first).

If you report a bug, please save the log file and attach it to the issue, it's almost impossible to diagnose a problem without it.
