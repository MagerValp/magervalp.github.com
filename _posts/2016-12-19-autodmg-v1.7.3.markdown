This week I've rounded up some bugfixes together with a few minor new features. First off, after a successful build you'll find a few machine parsable statements in the log, to help people who automate builds. You'll also see a warning if the build number changes, as it does these days when you install a security update:

    15 december 2016 11:35:55 GMT−5  Build success: OUTPUT_PATH='/Users/Shared/osx_updated_161216-10.11.6-15G31.hfs.dmg'
    15 december 2016 11:35:55 GMT−5  Build success: OUTPUT_OSNAME='Mac OS X'
    15 december 2016 11:35:55 GMT−5  Build success: OUTPUT_OSVERSION='10.11.6'
    15 december 2016 11:35:55 GMT−5  Build success: OUTPUT_OSBUILD='15G1212'
    15 december 2016 11:35:55 GMT−5  Build success: Notice: OS version changed from Mac OS X 10.11.6 15G31 to Mac OS X 10.11.6 15G1212

Secondly I've added a deprecation warning if you're building an OS that is no longer supported by Apple, as is the case now with 10.9. This also means that I will remove support for it in AutoDMG in the not too distant future, most likely in the next major release.

Full changelog:

* Display warning if Apple has stopped updating the target OS.
* Only update the profile if the running OS is supported.
* Handle already mounted `InstallESD.dmg` if installer app was moved afterwards.
* Abort the build if disk image creation fails.
* Print warning in log when build number changes during install.

You'll find the download on the [AutoDMG releases](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) page.
