![AutoDMG 1.0](/images/AutoDMG-1.0.png)

I've received some great feedback during the past few days, but since no major issues have been reported I'm feeling confident enough to release [AutoDMG](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG) version 1.0.

A big thank you goes out to everyone who helped with the testing.

The changes for 1.0 include:

* Polished UI.
* Better logging.
* Fix list of updates being refreshed after profiles updated.
* Added warnings for deprecated installers.
* Confirm to quit when building.
* Added preferences for automatic updates.

You can download 1.0 from the [AutoDMG releases](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) page.
