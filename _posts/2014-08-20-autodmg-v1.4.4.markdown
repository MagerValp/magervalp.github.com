Thanks to our great community a few more AutoDMG bugs have been discovered. I rolled up the fixes today and released 1.4.4:

* Fixed crash when user has unicode characters in primary group name.
* Better error handling when downloads fail or additional packages are moved.
* Verify passwords in CLI to avoid failed builds.

I've also released a new beta of 1.5 for Yosemite testers. It contains the same fixes as 1.4.4.

You can download 1.4.4 and 1.5b from the [AutoDMG releases](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) page.
