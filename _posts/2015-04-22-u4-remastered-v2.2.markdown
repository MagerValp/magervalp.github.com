A few more bugs [were reported](http://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=670851#670851) (thank you!), and I really wanted to get my list of known bugs down to zero. Unless people discover even more bugs this is likely to be the final release.


## Atari & Apple II ports

Users from the other 6502 platforms have also shown some interest in remastered versions. I don't have any contacts in the Apple or Atari cracking scene, so I thought I'd put a note in here. If you're interested let me know and I can help you navigate the project.


## What's New in v2.2

* The game no longer hangs when playing the 1541 version and answering questions wrong in the codex.
* Attacking static NPCs such as Ankhs, castle lords & ladies, the water in Castle Britannia, or the camp fire in Yew no longer leads to a glitching enemy in combat. Attacking chests dropped by townespeople is no longer possible.
* Fixed stack handling for main menu, when being attacked by monsters, when dying, and the end game. This hopefully eliminates any crashes to the ready prompt.
* The avoid combat trainer now works in dungeons too.


## Download & Source Code

* You can download the game from its CSDb entry: [Ultima IV Remastered v2.2](http://csdb.dk/release/index.php?id=137951).
* The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/MagerValp/u4remastered).
