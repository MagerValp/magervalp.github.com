I have released AutoDMG 1.5 which contains the following bugfixes:

* Include custom volume name when saving a template from the GUI.
* Fixed resolving of certain aliases on 10.10.
* Fixed error message when log file couldn't be opened.
* Fixed building when a mobile account is roaming and can't look up its username.

You can download 1.5.3 from the [AutoDMG releases](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) page.
