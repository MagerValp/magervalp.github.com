I've been working on implementing caching in AutoDMG, but the bugs kept piling up in the meantime. I decided to break the silence with a small bugfix release:

* Allow renamed InstallESD images (but they still have to match `InstallESD*.dmg`).
* Fix message regarding deprecated installers on 10.8.
* Fix a crash if the user's primary GID doesn't have a corresponding group.
* Fix deletion of multiple additional packages.

I also published new update profiles for 10.9.1 and 10.8.5 earlier today which should be downloaded automatically.

You can download 1.2.1 from the [AutoDMG releases](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) page.
