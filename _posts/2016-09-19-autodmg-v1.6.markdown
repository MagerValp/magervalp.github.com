Just in time for macOS Sierra we have AutoDMG 1.6:

* Added 10.12 support.
* Removed 10.8 support.
* AutoDMG will not try to remount already mounted images, fixing 10.12 installer.
* Added advanced option to skip asr imagescan (thanks @timsutton).
* AutoDMG will not relaunch on login (thanks @nmcspadden).
* Fixed volume size setting not being saved to templates (thanks @timsutton).
* Fixed handling of relative package paths on the command line (thanks @timsutton).
* Fixed usage of base image as source on the command line (thanks @timsutton).

You can download 1.6 from the [AutoDMG releases](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) page. If you have questions or need help, you can join us in [`#autodmg`](https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/autodmg) on [Slack MacAdmins](http://macadmins.org) (but please check the [documentation](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/wiki) and especially the [FAQ](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/wiki/FAQ) first).
